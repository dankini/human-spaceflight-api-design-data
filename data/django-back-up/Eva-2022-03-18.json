Carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes' worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen, Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his 15.35 m (50.4 ft) tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his space suit ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock, 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) in diameter and 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) long. He improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking \"the bends\". This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by 1.8 °C (3.2 °F) from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in weightlessness and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the Cold War.", "image_photo": "astronaut/photos/FirstSpaceWalk_JwD4eH6.png"}, {"id": "23f72063-4be4-4c7b-84ef-ad63e803ae57", "code": 2, "astronaut": "799b3888-ea90-495a-a550-5a7f7bd96031", "date": "1965-06-03", "type": "SW", "duration_secs": "0:20:00", "tethered": "TE", "planned": "PL", "notes": "The first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by Ed White from the second crewed Gemini flight, Gemini IV, for 21 minutes. White was tethered to the spacecraft, and his oxygen was supplied through a 25-foot (7.6 m) umbilical, which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation. He was the first to control his motion in space with a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit, which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonov's claim.\r\n\r\nHowever, a defect in the capsule's hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive.", "image_photo": "astronaut/photos/EdWhiteFirstAmericanSpacewalker.1965.ws.jpg"}, {"id": "69f94f08-a0ff-4dc0-8df0-f09390d3d556", "code": 3, "astronaut": "60c97a0f-9053-483e-b68b-dc4cdc1d1444", "date": "1966-06-06", "type": "SW", "duration_secs": "2:07:00", "tethered": "TE", "planned": "PL", "notes": "", "image_photo": "astronaut/photos/Gemini-9_eva-cernan.jpg"}, {"id": "dd60a8fd-9ed1-43d2-88d7-fa234cef01f5", "code": 4, "astronaut": "b0580843-bd93-45c9-a43b-48bf31d0b2b2", "date": "1966-07-19", "type": "SU", "duration_secs": "0:49:00", "tethered": "TE", "planned": "PL", "notes": "For his first EVA Collins did not leave the Gemini capsule, but stood up through the hatch with an ultraviolet camera.
